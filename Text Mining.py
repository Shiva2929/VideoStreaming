sentence = "welcome to the FinTech face-off my name is Jennifer grizzle and I lead global marketing for services enterprise business here at LinkedIn the future of Finance is already here but clarity remains elusive the flare up and flame up of FinTech unicorns the race of incumbents to innovate while challengers scale the the shadow of big tech Demuth's and the portent of chinese platforms in many debates they discuss these topics however many events are too formulaic and they don't get at the heart of the matter thus we conceived an event with a difference the FinTech face-off a collaboration between Capgemini linkedin and xi FS in this transatlantic tussle we have teams both in America and Europe who are gonna flex their FinTech muscle they'll compete discussing the future finance and new viewers have a role too so grab your seats share your views and crown the winner moderating live from New York is CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger over to you Jill thanks so much so my role here today is to be a really good traffic cop and we have a Bobby over in London for the European side her name is Sarah Kochanski so the two of us are going to moderate this live event want to thank everybody at LinkedIn Capgemini and 11 FS for helping to pull this off an amazing effort so the first job here is to actually introduce you to our team team America's code captains Shanker krishnan partner Capgemini sam mall managing partner 11 FS and our Team America debaters starting with beau Hartmann the CIO at Goldman Sachs Bank and the CTO of Marcus Clara SH I see

Consulate General New York and now we're gonna go back to Jill who's gonna give us some more insight in how today is going to work some housekeeping rules and more details on the all-important voting element of today's event thank you so much so we've all been to conferences and I know you've sat in these and you thought to yourself it's just the same stuff over and over again well this is going to break the mold we're gonna cover some topics that have been in the conversation but not in this format we're hoping to break new ground with a lively engaging and illuminating debate and I want to be sure that everybody understands that much of this debate was based on a fantastic report which you can get the Capgemini LinkedIn world FinTech report for 2018 you should check that out using that we've divided the event into two main sections the first hour will be financial services customer trust and journey the second our collaboration models between fintechs and traditional financial services firms now each of these two main topics has to has five specific questions so it's gonna move along very quickly in case someone goes too long not that that whatever happened with any of the fabulous panelists on either side of the Atlantic but just in case we're gonna have a timer we're also going to have a buzzer if they go too long it's kind of like a high-stakes chess match meets a frenetic gameshow our modified format for a debate will be as follows for each question both teams will start by laying out their opening positions each team will then have the opportunity to go first the Americas will kick off the odd numbers the European team will open the even numbers at the conclusion of the opening positions from both teams each team will then have a rebuttal period then one of the team captains will sum up the round and you then have to do a little bit of work it's time for you to vote and the way that you vote is you go to Twitter and you will follow the instructions at the bottom of your screen they'll be specific specific should hashtags to use Sarah and I will each announce the results of the rounds at the end of the subsequent round are you ready because it is going to be a very bumpy ride let's go okay here we go the first section customer trust and journey and what we know now is that expectations for convenience and personalization or driving firms to quickly adjust to meet customer needs the companies that deliver personalized relevant and seamless solutions will be among the winners our first question what are the most overhyped and underwhelming emerging technologies in financial services today which technology actually has the most realistic chance of redefining the banking experience we are going to turn to Katherine for the opening position for the Americas thank you the Social Security Administration was founded in 1935 as a social insurance insurance program to pay retired workers in 1946 the administration added the words not to be used for identification to the card because even 80 years ago they knew better than that absent any other way to identify consumers for everything from financial transactions to health care services to employment the social security number quickly became the only way to confirm a consumers identity this scheme as we all know is seriously flawed a quick google search for kyc solutions yields page after pages of ads and for all kinds of services claiming to solve any company's identity verification was by the way if anyone from pega systems is listening I think you're spending a little too much money on Adwords mm-hmm take a quick walk through anything tech conference and you'll see booth after booth of identity verification startups identity management solutions are the most overhyped and underwhelming emerging technologies today how many of you were disappointed I didn't go with Bitcoin on this all the new companies alike seek to fix our broken national system of identity verification they can't do it but it's not their fault increased regulation about identity management after 9/11 was very well intentioned and the regulation continues to flow from FinCEN as we attempt to curtail money laundering and terrorism financing we all want this not just for AML kyc purposes but for everything every day reveals yet another story of a hacked system company or election our national security depends on solving this problem and some of our best and brightest technology minds have their heart set in solving it but until our governments adopt a national identity management strategy once centered around something other than an easily guessed purchased or stolen nine digit ID the problem simply can't be solved many countries around the world have tackled this issue with technology including densely populated countries like Indonesia in India Social Security numbers were never intended to be used broad to broadly verify identity and it's clear that our continued use of them puts our identities and our democracies at risk the only solution that will work is a willing coalition of public and private organizations that work together on this issue until then every tech company the claims to have the Identity Management crisis solved is just biding their time until the next breach thank you all right fantastic Katherine thank you so much and now we will have the opening position for the European team Suresh lay it out for us okay so the overtype technology is obvious blockchain in its fifth or sixth year it's like a hammer looking for a nail and it's found a whole bunch of nails that are holding some art things together so I would look at from a banking perspective blockchain as this is extremely overhyped is unlikely to it's it's likely to come back in a different way but as it is it's it's it's meant for a decentralized banking system not for a centralized Bank a regulated banking system in terms of underwhelming technologies ice you know I start to lean more towards Katherine but more towards what I think is a preventative compliance regime in banking because end of the day the biggest what we caught Block in a bank the thing that slows everything down is compliance and in a digital world if the number of transactions we're going to do goes through an order of magnitude of one or two or three and three zeros the what's slowing us down is going to completely gridlock banking and you cannot do whatever you need to do whether it's simple payments so it's it's it's how you do preventative compliance how do you have you re engineered banking is not talked about as much as the front-facing consumer facing or blockchain type you know the hyped word so I would say parented at compliance and one of the key things that you need for preventative compliance is the digital identity which Katherine talked about because a lot I would say more than half of the problems comes from trying to build a profile against or trying to build a unique profile against a human being or an entity and you don't have a public good like you have an India or in some other countries where a digital identity is a public good whereas in in the u.s. it's what is a reasonable effort of a banker to find out what your identity is and which can be completely disagreed with by regulator so you have absolute opacity on how you actually manage identity verification in one of the most developed countries there are other countries that have figured this out like Mexico where you're going to soon have digital identity I believe but I think that is very underwhelming but it's actually one of the inputs into compliance is digital identity and that today to me is very underwhelming and I think that needs to be looked at so both all right well now this is quite interesting because we have two different views of this Kathryn lays out the identity management systems as underwhelming Suresh the blockchain of course we knew someone was going to add and bring that up I also note with great laughter his idea around the compliance issues since I am married to a compliance professional and I was sort of hoping that would be like for the rest of my life but maybe not now we've got first up for the US team we're going to have our rebuttal from Jeff Jeff take it away thanks Jill so I would say I would say the most overhyped technologies AI and the one who has most promises AI and I say that because we use this as such an amorphous blob of technology and candidly most people have no idea what they're actually talking about we're talking about artificial intelligence and there are aspects about artificial intelligence anomaly detection identification of opportunities next best action that are really powerful and can drive your business forward and then you sort of drift into this sort of sentient being space and we are so far away away from those things we've done a lot of testing ourselves and you know our jobs are safe for a while particularly in the high-end world and and what we have found is that we have to stop making this conversation about who is smarter myself or the Machine and start talking about how we make ourselves better at what we do using the technology that's available lots of players in this space or sort of chasing after bots and I met with a firm the other day who shall remain nameless who basically said listen I can create a bot for you in ten minutes if you give me a bunch of questions answers you can create a really bad bot in ten minutes with a lot of technology today it takes months and even years to actually do it the right way the second thing I'll say the second most powerful thing you have your organization is actually not a piece of technology its leadership and its culture and we spend so much time talking about the next new cool widget that's sort of coming down the line that's gonna take us to the next century and the reality is the reason you will fail has nothing to do with the fact that there is not a vendor solution to marketplace that can solve your problem the reason you will fail is because you could not align your business object and your organizational structure to embrace these new technologies in a way that actually grow your business and move the needle forward thanks Joe okay we're now going to go to the European rebuttal and Claire will lay out that argument it's it's interesting we are talking since the beginning about technology when we define the customer experience for me it's really the customer that is defining this experience and we have not talked about it for the last you know five minutes or six minutes customer are setting the bar this is why you know FinTech set the bar you know in terms of offering new solutions this is what we aspire to offer the same type of experience it's really about the customer then I would totally agree with some of the comments that were made around you know the alignment execution of the technology but I think the second part we didn't really discuss is you know the underlying data because for me you know digital digital identity is just a way and a mean to access to banking services and blockchain is just a container that will store very securely distributed data and to some extent you know chat but is just our air is just a manipulation of this data really data is the underlying not technology but the underlying assets that is we will make change and redefine the banking experience on the future the ability of organization to have highly personalized experience that they deliver to the customer is a trend we are seeing clearly in the industry so for me you know it's not about digital identity it's not about blockchain it's not about a is not about Redbirds bad customer and data captain who will provide a nice tidy summation for you Sam give us a summation of round one so actually at first I got to say this because my wife keeps texting me I know my socks don't match alright and it's futile ice fault he did the laundry I swear to God the kid has no attention span and it's driving me crazy all over in a minute what's the most overhyped technology frickin everything seriously if there's an industry that can overhype we're it right we push we a I like crazy blockchain like crazy we talking about big data we over hype everything what about the most underwhelming everything okay honestly thank you Elon Musk for launching a car into space that was pretty cool I like that but I like what Bill Gates says he's smarter than me yeah I think everybody knows this quote we always over always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 don't let yourself be lulled into inactive I got that in crowded okay now it is your turn to do something yourselves as you watch this wonderful debate go on to Twitter and start your voting process you will see there are two different hashtags one for the Americas one for the European team and you will now be able to vote we will announce the winner of this first round in our next round and for that next round I am going to Sarah who will start in with round two thank you so much Jill what an exciting start we've already hit blockchain a I am compliance and we're only twenty minutes in so we're going to continue that trend and move on to a subject dear to many of those in the FinTech industries hearts data and specifically how firms can extract maximum value from it so our second question is how a company's leveraging data to understand customer needs improve trust and drive engagement and loyalty a reminder that our panelists can use examples from other industries if they like on this one we go straight over to Jamie he's going to give us the opening position for the EU [Music] well before we get started talking about data in the EU we really have to mention GDP are we mentioned earlier around how customers and companies are helping you know customers trust the companies that they use and GDP are is one of those initiatives which has been led by the u EU and pioneered across the world you know as a real standpoint about putting trust and power back in the customers hands so I think that's one that we definitely need to get out of the way first in terms of how companies are helping customer customers achieve more with their data really when we're talking about financial services we're talking about unlocking hidden meaning in transactional data companies such as Bud we're helping small businesses go through the go through the onboarding processes of applying for small business loans we're partnering with a company like I Walker to pre-fill forms and make sure that companies can go through those processes as quickly as possible because let's face it if you're a small business you don't to spend all your time filling out forms equally on the consumer side going deeper into how your how your spending is what it's saying about your life so really joining the dots between your spending and what that means for you so if you're spending money and on an airport or in a traveling capacity you know really providing the information back to customers on on on exchange rates really being proactive with how data is being used in connecting people to those to those high pieces of information all those notes that you're right you know they're really really got your head instantly thank you so much gents right thank you very much and now we're gonna go back to Clara who's gonna give us the u.s. is opening position so everyone's talking about data but it's really not about data it's about insights and what you do with the data and insights it's interesting to talk about how data can be used to drive engagement and try when you need to have engagement and Trust in the first place to be able to get the data from consumers in the first place so let's talk about digital direct and digital advised digital direct highly transactional we know it's a race to the bottom there's a lot of data so the volume of data is there but the quality of data some of the most rich interactions happen with advisers and this is true both for commercial clients as well as high net-worth individuals that firms most valuable clients generally have some sort of advisor because those clients demand concierge services and with digital with data with automation we can help scale those concierge services down the chain which is why we see everyone from established firms to Schwab and Vanguard to even fin tech firms like betterment now actually having human advisers in that hybrid model so we know the big unlock is really the advisors what's happening right now is a black box frankly and so how are firms solving this almost every firm that we talk to it here say they are even either considering or have already deployed some sort of CRM system multi millions of dollars to deploy many years to get settled so they put it out there and then what happens nothing because advisors like any of us don't like to do manual data entry so they stand up these fancy CRM systems and advisers don't after they have a great meeting with a prospect or client the first thing that they do isn't to run back to their computer and enter all of their notes in a CRM it's just not realistic and so these CRM systems stand pretty empty and there ends up being this huge divide between what's happening at corporate and what's happening with digital direct all of this data high volume disconnected with what's happening in the field that therein lies our biggest opportunity both in Europe as well as in the US compliance can actually be our friend when it comes to data books and records requirement where we have to capture and supervise everything that happens from calls to text messages to social media to email that is actually it the burden to capture but it's actually an advantage when you're thinking about collecting data in structured ways thank you thank you so much Clara so really interesting opening positions there we managed to hit gdpr that's four out of four we were talking about compliance more broadly again you know how it can help with these with these data questions and indeed the democratization of services so reminder to our audience that if you like what you heard you can head over to Twitter to vote on who you think had the best position there and whilst you're doing that we're gonna go over to Suresh she's going to deliver the rebuttal for the European team so data banking is bad data it doesn't have good data that's at least my learning so far because end of the day banking is in the business of Commerce enabling consumers and businesses which means they're doing something else to do a commercial transaction and our role in banking is to enable that or even understand what they need at the right time and provide the ability to do a value transfer or provided a loan or liquidity meet a liquidity gap so what we found is as banking is evolving the data from the past historical data is very bad because may there was memory constrained bad machine you know smaller machines and you don't have the contextual data that you need to do what this end is a I we can't even get there you have to get to machine learning to get to machine learning we don't even have good data to learn in a very organized structured way so what you hear about AI is people can a kind of collecting forms and things and you know the front and you can do some some amount of social media engagement and mobile app engagement so what we found is you're gonna have an order of magnitude of data per transaction that you didn't have five six years ago so that's gonna allow you to do some things incrementally but not in a dramatically improved fashion it's gonna drive some amount of engagement we're gonna see some changes in bill pay maybe it's going to anticipate your amount of bill you're gonna pay and maybe even offer a loan it's going to do the same thing in terms of wealth management but it's not gonna be what you see in the some of the ads or think that some computer voice talks to you and tells you you know you should be buying this stock selling stocke that's not gonna happen it's still gonna be human led human being led so from my perspective yes there is going to be a data assistant engagement models draught banking and there are certain areas where banking can collect really good data - really good machine learning that would lead to more let's say faster tools for helping customers to make decisions faster through endpoint devices which could be a Google home Alexa could even be a you know a smartphone so I believe in a dancer thanks Suresh okay so it's over to Dan for the us's rebuttal that's a very sunny outlook Suresh Wow so it's not going to get better and it's too hard so I think one thing that we touched on that is very important is that you need high quality data and the way that you do that is you invest in systems to generate high quality data one of the things that we do a lot of is many iterative small experiments so you don't need big data you need the right size data to answer the questions so that you can change the product that the customer sees how they experience it we've been able to do this in a number of ways to help clients make better decisions like maybe they shouldn't sell that stock or maybe they shouldn't change their allocation that involves also owning enough of the data through the entire pipeline so that you're not relying on third parties who can't do what you need them to do betterment has a feature called tax impact preview that before a client goes through with the transaction we are actually able to estimate the tax impact and tell them whether or not we think it's a good idea for them to go through with that based on the taxes that are going to incur so I think that the customer experience and how your systems the the infrastructure that you invest in so that the product changes the service changes over time because of the personal experience that each client has is incredibly important and the investment that you need to do this is the big difference it's not a matter of generating data it's a matter of taking that data and iteratively changing the product that the customer experiences I'm gonna end on one sort of strange question is the UK still part of the EU there's some smack down there Sarah too early well well the the corrector the empty answer is that yes it is for now we're gonna turn it over to Elias he's gonna give us a quick summary on his thoughts from that first round so technically yes UK as part of the you as we speak so I think what are the messages first gdpr is big time changing the way we engage concierge having the right data available having more smart data be able to get the right information I love the example of saying well salespeople don't run to the CRM so we need to help them get there but for me also the most important part what my colleague was trying to say also spiced t2 in Europe what we are doing here is also now enabling everybody to have access to the data and by having a salute to the data now we can get smarter decisions I think the example that Suresh gave about Alexa now I will be able to engage with Alexa not only for basic stuff but maybe for more complex stuff based on my behavioral base of my family based of my family Alexa could get me differently thank you guys thank you everyone in fact and now we're gonna go back to Jill who's gonna let us know which team won round one and summarize how you can vote on the round you've just seen over to you Jill okay thank you so much Sarah okay round one the winner is America's okay now remember if you would like to vote in this round that we've just completed round 2 is really quite vibrant I must say just go to Twitter and follow the hashtags down at the bottom of your screen you could vote for either the Americas or for the European teams and don't forget to weigh in and comment hashtag WFT r18 and now it is on to round 3 okay so we know that driving insights through data is key for this personalized experience we've just talked about big data small data incremental data whichever way you want to do it but here's the question all the companies have the data they have technology how are they going to get there here is your question number three how can banks meet rising expectations while saddled with legacy systems our api's and open banking the final answer or simply a stopgap solution for the Americas the opening position will be delivered by Bo so first off I want to say Simon haven't seen you a while that's a beautiful jumper thank you for wearing it my friend so the the question has a lot to unpack the first part about it is can you know these legacy companies overcome the debts that they have and we talked about technical debt which we'll get to well it's more important there are three major debts instead of these legacy firms that they have to overcome first one is product and process that second one is organizational debt and third one's technical debt which will tag at the very end of this the first part is there's a lot of products and processes that the firm's really have a hard time going after it's difficult to retire a product it's very hard to change a process inside of an ingrained organization the second one is organizational debt organ organization 'old ette is challenging that's a cultural move you have to move hearts and minds and when you have large organizations they create something that I'd like to refer to as the immune system and the immune system is there to protect it for free compliance reasons regulatory reasons or just the fact that we've always done it that way and to tackle that one companies put a lot of effort into it but it's very hard to move the massive needle without moving those two pieces actually moving the third debt is very challenging technical debt but we like to focus on it because of all the overhyped things that my colleagues talked about earlier and it's also the big-ticket item in the budgets CEOs and CFOs look at that line item and then they say hey what if I cut 1/3 of that out look at all the things I would save through automation but if you don't tackle those first two Automation can only make it so far before I get to the API and open banking question because everyone likes to jump to the solution but talk about how we tackled it and Marcus Marcus by Goldman Sachs those three debts that I talked about actually were very very impactful to my thinking before I joined marcus by goldman sachs i lived my career in major companies that were partially good at tackling those things or failed completely at tackling those things and this the ideas that i generated in those times of running those platforms is that yes i can put a new automation system in or yes i could always put a CRM system in but at the end of the day if I don't move those things then I'm just really pretty much putting a veneer over other areas technology and these large organizations are gangly insists that stretch out everywhere the last part that I'd liked is to say on the API is an open banking really quickly is there a good frameworks and they're just frameworks there's something that's going to come out after that and we as technologists just have to be one step ahead and making sure that we're doing okay thank you and now over the pond to the opening position for Europe Suresh Europe so I don't end of agree with him but I have a different take on this having gone through a transformation there are four things I love which I've learned in the last five years on this one is banking as it is a legacy banks or transaction system so you have like some in some even in a small bank when we bought when we had like 20 plus transaction systems and I'm assuming a large bank has thousands of unique transaction systems so banking is a process business running on a siloed transaction system and organization structure is kind of built around these transaction systems you have a head of cards head of debit head of this head of that whereas really Accords are token for accessing money from a number in a database so we had to rethink banking as a process and if you really do that it banking comes down to less than 50 processes end to end with including embedding compliance in it right so that is the first thing you have to do is to do an organizational transformation you got to figure out what your processes look like without which you don't know which way to redo the org right the next thing we looked at was there is a lot of cost centers that are built around and what we call third-party vendor transaction systems that really prevent you from offering solutions that that that really would meet the consumer needs but the cost structure of multiple transaction systems don't enable you to do that it could be bill pay it could be card issuance so we redid all of that so we moved a lot of cost centers to profit centers and one of the things that we the issues in banking is settlement and reconciliation is not talked about much but it's a single biggest headache in banking because you could spend a thousand dollars chasing a dollar in in a discrepancy so we had to figure out how to do real-time settlement and reconciliation across all kinds of products so you have to redefine how you do these these flows in banking so once you get to that then you get to the third thing nothing moves in banking without real-time compliance so the existing legacy compliance regime is first transaction random sampling of a few transactions to test and so other than watchlist testing that doesn't scale well because you have sure all the big banks are building full of a false positive watchers people whose only job is to look at false positives and you know remove them or to put them into a case management so we went to a real-time data analytics of every transaction that allows you to actually scale up with lower costs if you do all this you get to a different place you get to a where the bank is poorly addressable today to a tokenize bank account becomes a smart account so the bank account itself is going to evolve from a simple static ledger base account all right well so this is kind of fascinating because it looks like we're addressing the problem from two very specific stand points I think that when you think about those three different debts the four different ways to rethink your banking you've got a lot to contend with if you think one of these two guys made a better argument head on over to Twitter where you can vote just look at the hashtags on your screen and you can start voting now or you may want to wait till after the rebuttal period so now let's go to our beautiful rebuttal list Zac for the Americas you're lovely I've been called many things but beautiful is not one of but I haven't called a father and so first and foremost I'm a dad but I'm a child of the 80s and so I'm a child of the 80s and I'm a parent of 2018 and so imagine a conversation I would have with my daughter who's six and if I looked at her and I said honey I'm sorry I can't parent you because I'm a child of the 80s I don't I don't know how to be a parent because it's 2018 but I love her and so what I've had to do it I've had to reboot my own internal operating system to be a parent of 2018 not a child of the 80s who's tried to be a parrot of 1980 and so how are banks any different well I love my daughter but if you ask your bank does your bank love you does your bank care for you did your bank want to see you achieve your goals the answer in many cases no but the answer should be yes and if the answer is yes then the bank needs to figure out how and having an excuse that legacy systems and operations and processes can enable the bank to serve you is not acceptable the answer has to be start somewhere start somewhere make it easy for your customers to do business with you make sure that their data is safe and secure help them pay down debt help them send their child to college those are things you could do today before you touch your core operating systems so I would encourage you bankers and you Europeans think like a parent love your customers we're printing up t-shirts does your bank heart you any moment now okay we are going to go over to Europe delivering the rebuttal for the European team is Simon should I wait for the buzzer know how to start my bank loves you genuinely we love our customers I'm Simon I'm an engineer I work at monsley we built a bank from scratch in three years so I feel a bit disingenuous talking about legacy because we haven't got any but I have worked for big banks before I've worked with banks where you'd work for twelve months to get one tiny little change they didn't even really affect the customers when you say legacy I like to like divide the world into like not just like legacy means there's stuff that you don't really understand that's old I'd like I'd like to defy the define the world by like before Google and after Google see a few years ago Google basically took the technology that powers their data centers they took micro services and kubernetes and a programming language called golang and they basically open sourced all that and they put all that out in the world and if you look around the top tech companies now pretty much like all of the big ones are using the same tech stack they're using micro services they're using container management systems like kubernetes and they're using languages like golang to basically build software the way you can release things at the speed of thought you know you can write some code like I literally release a feature to our staging environment while I was waiting for this thing to start yep like that is the product like it's not good enough anymore to say like are we managing down a legacy we're managing down our technical debt no if you if you're a company that he's been born after this sort of like step change in the way IT is done then you're never going to catch up when we were building ones like from scratch we started three years ago we talked to a lot of people about like what even is a core banking system and no one could really tell us like is it a a series of credits and debits that sum to zero or does it include the card processing or do you have to have an end-of-day batch like what are we even talking about and in the end we decided that we will just have one system like one giant system it doesn't have an API it is an API it uses HTTP all the way from the customers all the way through our core back-end systems is just one giant API so there's no legacy systems to manage so I don't really know what the answer is all right like our API is the final solution or a stopgap I don't know I think that they you know api's are going to change banking they're going to change the world forever they're going to make customers data available to customers in a way that they they want to use that data whether or not we move to a post API world where we use smart contracts like that might be the future but for now API is a such a big thing like don't try to look past them just embrace them you know and build a new bank build a new core banking system so they have we built the whole bank in three years Wow it's pretty tough man okay Shanker you've got your work cut out for you give us a quick summary of this third round absolutely glad to do that great conversation around the room today I think sometimes banks like smoking kills need to have something which says legacy kills because legacy comes in the way of smart ideas legacy comes in the way of good ideas there is oftentimes a lot of business rules that the business folks or want to take to the market but legacy stifles so the good news for us is that I mean soonish is a good example of having created an API that works for payments we see mule soft RPG and folks like that build billion dollar businesses backs on API so I think API is a good short-term solution what I see happening is that there's going to be a lot of api's public/private and third party that API management is going to be the next signs so legacy is a problem API helps us for now long ways to go banks need to change move into new systems and be the api's themselves like Simon was saying that would be mine thank you very much okay so we now have our winner for round two going to for two it is America's once again for round two don't get so high on your horse come on there's a long way to go here remember that you can vote by going on to Twitter just look at those hashtags at the bottom of your screen and you will be able to vote live at any time and it's time to move on to our fourth question and for that we go over to Sarah who will take over now Thank You Jill well that was exciting and indeed emotional I would say come on guys we've got some work cut out for us here let's see if we can we can win the next round here which is on a subject matter that has sparked debate across the financial services sector and indeed far beyond we're talking blockchain is it the cure to all firms inefficiency woes or is it an overhyped technology that's never gonna take off we're gonna start off with Simon who's gonna give us his opening position on the question which is what does blockchain hold for future and financial services thanks a lot Sarah oh man I like clearing up Harry and defending blockchain in front of a bunch of cynical people as a it's a it's tough gig but I'm gonna give it a go so the killer use case for blockchain exists its cryptocurrency there's like hundreds of billions of dollars of value locked up in in the public block chains the two biggest being the etherium and Bitcoin block chains but the use case that really excites me more than the sort of self issuing crypto currencies is the idea that commercial banks and central banks could actually issue crypto currencies I'm not suggesting the Bank of England doesn't I see oh by the way before we get down there but three years ago we started ones oh and two years ago I worked on the project to get us connected to the faster payment scheme and the way that actually worked was we had to you know actually physically plug fiber-optic cables you know the other end of which was at the clearing system into our data center which was really hard because we're in the cloud but we managed it and then we had to write esoteric software to speak like really really old-school protocols to actually talk to the central infrastructure and I I kept thinking the whole time like this would be so much easier if there was just the trust in cryptography if there was just a smart contract out there where we could take you know the amount of value we were attempting to send from one bank to another like as a central bank issue crypto currency and send it to a smart contract with instructions as to who the final recipient was right it would have saved it's like a year of hard work so as an engineer like for me the technology it seems novel and it seems very very powerful and I'm not really I don't really think it's um I think once you've actually played around with it it's it it is credible it's not just pure hype blockchain has been around for ten years now and a lot of engineers think it's um it's it's a it's a it's good technology it just it's going to require like multiple parties to be on both sides of every trade right so the like to get access to like when you get access to faster payments in the UK that's just a clearing system basically you're just sending messages about you know who's gonna receive the money and who's sending the money but the actual settlement system that actually happens at the central bank so that happens at the Bank of England and the old lady of Threadneedle Street doesn't work on the weekends right like so you you basically you only settle three or four times a day and that puts counterparty risk out there as well if the central banks were actually you know brave enough to embrace blockchain and issue their commercial banks with some personalized national currency issue them with actual currency thank you very much Simon so now it's over to Jane for the u.s. is opening position thanks Simon for that very well-rounded argument I think anyone who's been in the FinTech space a while or frankly any technology space you know to beware the profits and you know who I'm talking about right every conference you go to they have the solution for how everything is gonna change I've been in technology since the 90s and every year is the year of something it's year of search it's your social it's your mobile it's your of e-commerce and everything is going to change but technology is additive and one of the big issues with blockchain is a there was a lot of profits and a lot of money without really a whole lot of use cases coming quickly thereafter and be some of the these profits we're talking a lot of theory right show me show me the money show me where it actually goes so in wealth specifically I am an investment advisor in the wealth sector there really hasn't been a killer application beyond crypto like we have a database innovation and that's what blockchain is there's been a couple of exceptions in terms of innovation in wealth I think t0 have done something really interesting in terms of the backend of trading blockchain exchange which is launching next month should be a very interesting innovation but beyond that I think we can all admit that the innovations been pretty limp so I'm gonna issue a challenge to the province who may or may not come after me if you were to decoupled crypto from blockchain all we have is a database innovation challenge one challenge to what is the blockchain application that the humans of the world can get like seriously distributed ledger can we have some better words please that like some actual human beings can say this will make an impact on my life it's solving a problem that is not currently being solved however badly it showed me some exponential impact a lot of luck chain application that can actually make a genuine impact on my life thank you great thank you very much Jane so Shirley put a full house by now we've got cryptocurrency and I CEOs ticked off we've also got one blockchain evangelist and several challengers issued so let's see where we can get to when we get back the rebuttals but before we get there a reminder to vote for who you think won on the opening positions there now we're going to go over to nektarios for the e usual battle first of all we've done jumpers we've done socks can we please do sneakers I'm not even sure who I'm rebutting here but ultimately who cares why are we having this conversation there's where we run accelerators right so we see I don't know hundreds of startups every year about 25 to 33 percent according to a third of all applications that we get as somewhat blockchain related and most of them shouldn't be and most of them are really really terrible propositions but people get excited by the tech and they built something ago maybe you should use conventional technology at the same time we have all this industry fora that generates so much noise and we'd like to talk about noise because the reason we're doing this today is to get away from the noise right so why are we perpetuating the noise if I were to bring in a bottle of a Heinz product and would clock churn only that block generally would be like 58 varieties but nobody ultimately cares the other side to this is not that people don't care but it's the impatience with it this is new this is new territory this is completely new in the way we interact it's new technology it's different applications that we're still exploring but people are so impatient and it takes longer for somebody to be promoted within a bank that you actually see something like this happening to fruition but people getting very frustrated people are talking about oh it's not going to work there's no need for it reality is we have the opportunity to use something that is fundamentally new even if it's a new way of using databases that we can actually use quite effectively if we do it right and we give ourselves the time to explore at the moment we're an exploration stage right why are people being so negative about the exploration why are people so desperate to figure out the details what we're talking about tech rather than talking about solutions that we're looking to find for problems and then find the right technology to apply to this so it is frustrating at the same time it does something that nobody really addresses with has the potential to change the relationship and the ownership we have on data so we're moving from a space so we have the potential to move a space where somebody owns our data to us being able to control the data through this technology and this is a very interesting angle right but it's not part of the debate the debate is all about show us the money well maybe not yet but give us some time right the debate is all about war there's all these kind of icos what are they doing reality is yeah there's definitely companies who managed to raise millions in medicine money you shouldn't be that shouldn't be able to do that but give itself some time to breathe give it time give it time to actually consolidate itself and establish yourself that otherwise we'll end up having the faster horse rather than having the car Thank You NIC tereus so now we're gonna head back to Dan for the us's rebuttal so my background is behavioral economics right so I don't know anything about cryptography or regulatory systems or distributed Ledger's i explicitly am not allowed near our databases because that would be horribly dangerous so my view is mostly to answer the question about why people are negative about it to think about humanity blockchain is basically short humanity it is like saying I don't believe in trust I don't believe in society I don't believe in actually at some level the environment do you know how incredibly inefficient these systems are in terms of the electricity that they consume to do something that is again could you could you verify that the money is there and that we can move it and that we could keep track of that so to answer the question about why it's so negative blockchain is basically this entire expose of technical complicated solution that doesn't serve anybody who really wants it it is amazing how vapid the use cases are outside of cryptocurrencies where we can get people selling arms and drugs and moving currencies around third-world dictatorships so I can see I think it's Simon laughing they're not in my words but in the words of Matt Levine who is a financial columnist at Bloomberg I have a half-baked 3/4 joking theory of cryptocurrency which is that it is a magical incarnation of a sort of Internet male grievance people mostly men sit around on reddit complaining that they are underappreciated geniuses and it is unfair that they have not been rewarded with wealth they expect that the modern world should reward computer literacy and then they grew up to realize that the modern world much like the old wort rewards mostly people who have creativity and emotional intelligence and then Bitcoin came along and the paranoid computer literate people who spent a lot of time on the internet were the early adopters and became the world's first economica system that allocates wealth basically for hanging around on reddit thank you very much Dan so over here we have Simon Taylor who's going to give us what he thinks of the salient points on that subject matter I am NOT going to give you any salient points whatsoever I am gonna rant back at Dan and and I think primarily the term vapid was what stuck out to me right then if you've heard of modern slavery it's one of the most unfortunate of things in humanity at the moment people are manufacturing goods and services and not being paid for it well the problem with modern slavery is it's very hard to prove what's happening and where goods came from large retailers don't know where their goods come from even though throughout the process there is a certification and there is a completely well-known set of paper trails that happen throughout that and even though each of those people has a mobile device there is absolutely no single database that has all of world trade because what country do you put that in where do you centralize it what old technology do you centralize around so for a vapid use case how about preventing modern slavery how about preventing all kinds of Horrors like that that we see around the world I think we can do amazing things and I think blockchain is just getting started thank you very much all that was possibly one of the most passionate debates I've ever heard about blockchain I'm now gonna throw it back to Jan who's Jan I'm not I apologize I'm going to throw it back to Jill who is giving it to give us the results for the bracing on the previous round well round three the winner is Europe so now we have rounds 1 & 2 going to the America is round 3 going to Europe if you would like to vote head over to Twitter use the hashtags at the bottom of your screen weigh in on this it's very fun and now I guess that we've sort of gotten a lot of stretching done we've gotten art our juices flowing and that means it's time for the last question of this first section and it is Smackdown time if you didn't think the blockchain was gonna do it here we go here is question 5 Americas or Europe which has been more successful in building trust and delivering customer experience the opening position for the u.s. BOE you are up so I was I was very lucky I spent four and a half years of Barclaycard based out of London England and I was deeply immersed inside of the UK and European banking system years before that I was with Capital One I helped launch a business in France and help shut that prisons down as well so I had the experience of not doing digital banking very very well and then most of my career has been inside the United States in the banking organizations I'll have to tell you the best banking systems that I could see in the United in the world right now are in Europe and I know that so some of my colleagues in the United States might feel a little taken back about that but the Europeans specifically in the UK have definitely taken the lead in that domain about opening up PSD one and two most definitely opened up the doors for faster payments the open banking standards have been driven out of there the FinTech revolution I argue started in Europe but before the Europeans and get too excited about that I would tell you that the one thing about the US that you can always tell is that we are sleeping giant and when we wake up we're more than happy to borrow all the great ideas from around the globe to actually kick off and create innovation in and of itself we're actually seeing that with when I came to Marcus Vigo MICEX like I said earlier a lot of the things that impacted my past career created the things that we're building today so Marcus we started with building the from our consumers in the middle and building out we had 10,000 interviews and in those interviews we use the overlay of what are the things that you find most important to you being transparent being clear putting automation that was simple and easy instead of using tens of 20 versions of your data taking five simple elements and making a very quick decision and all of those are actually leading to a better place of customer experience and engagement also with our partnerships with the fintechs we're very happy to engage with fintechs and make them part of our ecosystem to improve the experience overall and so in from my standpoint why I believe the UK and the Europeans definitely have us out of the gate I think over the long term I think the Americans will actually come in and will actually be implementing the next version of innovation for the consumer and for the banking systems overall well sit ok for the opening position in Europe let's go to Simon who will take over from here for words treat the customer fairly that's it it's that simple the UK regulators when we were thinking about starting one so we're really super clear like all regulation basically boils down to don't break the law but treat the customers fairly and this was like been the ethos of I think of the financial services market in the in the UK for the last few years now ever since probably 2009 and you can see that coming everything like through gdpr through PSD to through giving customers access to their data it's all about treating the customer fairly but beyond that I think there's something else like if you want to build a trust with your customer you have to never betray them you have to never reorder their purchases so that you make the most amount of overdrafts or you have to not send them letters saying that you're going to you know charge them for an unauthorized overdraft fee after you've already charged them the an orthros overdraft fee you have to not charge them $30 for a 1 pound being overdrawn you have to basically it's so counter to have the way banks have been run for so long the way banks here used to be run so I think I think like at Monday we basically decided to be really really transparent about everything from the early days and the feedback from our customers has been incredible like people just love us they are obsessed with munzo the color of the cards with the like the you know it's like apparently it's a dating line now it's like if you've got mons oh and like all that comes back to basically treating the customers fairly and being transparent and so yeah that's it basically treat the customer fairly ok for words treat that customer fairly be transparent and will that us sleeping giant catch up you may want to vote on that right now if you do head over to Twitter hashtags at the bottom and feel free to weigh in on this argument hashtag WFT are 18 now for our rebuttal here in the u.s. miss Clara tell us what we need to know two words two words free market the customer will go where they're treated fairly venmo PayPal where did all these companies start the US will win in the long term because FinTech is driven by tech and tech is we lead tech in in the US and the fact that we have this scale means that as you heard from my partner Bo earlier that all the best ideas that we see in Europe and Asia Latin America around the world we will fold into the behemoth that is that a Silicon Valley in tech in everything America brilliant to top the Nook as good okay let's see we've got a European rebuttal I believe that that would be Simon who's up [Music] different Simon this time and I get two and a half minutes to speak yay sound shout out about your socks they're amazing and I'm sure they were ethnically sourced so I'm sure they came from some sort of blockchain all right so the interesting about free market and a big market is it's a big country with very different cultures and Americas are a very big place but especially North America you have the west coast and the East Coast you have policy on one side and tech on the other side and you have a five levels of federal regulation each state needs to get regulated getting anything done cost a lot of money and is extremely hard now there are good initiatives like labs CFTC and similar initiatives and the OCC that are coming out that will mean the u.s. will improve but I think if Europe has an advantage and especially the UK it's policy the ability to have three of the world's top ten universities within an hour's drive of London you've got all of the policy making decisions right there in London and you've got the tech center of Europe right there in London you've got Berlin just down the road and many of the great tech centers in the Nordics we have a burgeoning ability to grow a new set of businesses and I think the question was always will Europe developed the unicorns will it develop the DECA corns will it develop the really big companies and it was definitely behind the US where you had a capital that had been investing for some time in pure tech place so we saw stripe and we saw Square and we've seen those companies do well in a very large home market but now we're seeing the companies in the UK that have been around for a few years especially the Challenger banks not neo banks not an app on top of somebody else's banking license but an entirely new bank start to reach scale Starling Mons over Adam Oak north these organizations are starting to really grow and this is what excites me about you is really a lot of the policy around general data protection regulation that Jamie mentioned around PSD to in open banking is about creating a market in which fintechs can play and can succeed for consumers and it's in fact not doing that interior draconian way it's about treating customers fairly and I think principles based regulation is actually a lot easier to deal with it's it's nice to call the USA a free market but the reality is when you've got 50 different state regulators it's very expensive market alright that's mean well said ok we're going to have a summation of this final round in our first section and just remember right after this we will have a break so just remember that ok Sam would you like to summarize this wonderful Smackdown I think we all just came across as pompous asses we didn't talk about China we didn't talk about Africa I mean God come on I mean honestly right well let's look at what happened what's happened to China with mobile right and in cash ridiculous the take-up that's happened here at the end of the day it doesn't matter what we think the medical customers think right Marcus wherever you're at bow thank you God you do wonder pine right betterment you're doing fine Mons oh love you Simon by the way half a million customers I believe Starling well done again it doesn't matter Jack what we think it matters if customers sign up and use it that's the bottom line they're gonna tell us who wins and in China by the way they're kicking our ass alright ok guys this is very exciting because we have the round 4 winner and the winner of round 4 is Europe so we are tied up even steven - all right now and we're going to break now for just a quick 10-minute break while we are on break feel free to join the conversation on Twitter about this wonderful debate it's hashtag WFT r18 when we return our next section we'll be exploring collaboration models between fintechs and traditional service firms and that will begin in just about 10 minutes so thank you very much and we're gonna take a quick break here and get right back into it financial services customers order books food and travel with a few simple clicks they now expect no less from their financial services providers fintechs have been enabling new technologies for fs customers and their profound effect on the industry cannot be underestimated while fintechs continue to lead the way in transforming the customer journey the revolution that painted them as competitors is fizzling as these agile startups realize the struggle of competing alone the world FinTech report 2018 from Capgemini and LinkedIn in collaboration with ethnic explores the path forward for context and traditional FS players it is paved with mutually beneficial collaboration as they adapt and simultaneously brace themselves for the expected big tech expansion into financial services both fintechs and traditional firms bring different strengths fintechs have achieved their industry foothold by filling gaps left open by bringing innovation to the customer journey more than 90% of vintage say that agility and enhanced customer experience are their key competitive advantages which they say incumbents lacked incumbents hold customer trust and strong brands which are the new industry battlegrounds traditional firms also bring risk management regulatory expertise quick scalability and financially viable business models which are elusive to most fintechs it's becoming obvious that the best way forward is to combine the strengths of fintechs and incumbents through forming symbiotic relationships to meet customers growing expectations these collaborations must align with customer goals build trust and deliver digital agile and efficient processes such as hire personalization improved convenience increased speed of service in of interaction better functionality and proactive insights the use of advanced analytics predictive modeling and other innovative technologies is also necessary to create offerings that make customers want to return successful collaboration will depend on selecting the best partner an engagement model but a barrier to achieving this has been incumbents perceived unwillingness and lack of agility according to a majority of FinTech executives incumbent concerns involve a potential negative impact on trust brand and internal culture as well as IT compatibility one way to encourage successful collaboration is for fintechs to participate in Capgemini scale-up certification program a 360 degree review to qualify the most prepared scale ups for effective collaboration with financial institutions it will be important for these symbiotic relationships to take hold soon before long big texts such as Amazon Google Apple and Alibaba will be looking to expand their footprint into the industry Google Apple and Amazon have already expanded into the payment space in Alibaba and its subsidiaries is already ahead of the curve collaborating with a number of traditional players other big text will soon follow to learn more download the report at fin tech world report calm or contact us at financial services at Capgemini calm or Jay grizzle at LinkedIn calm you [Music] in a world in banking in which we've seen that college have been completely commoditized the only way to make a difference is through an excellent customer experience it differentiated customer experience and delivering that differentiating customer experience it is the global tax that have actually set the bench to our customers and raise the expectations so if you want to deliver on a differentiating customer experience in my view it has to adhere to the four principles of personal instant relevant and seamless [Music] the technologies that in my view are going to have the most impact on the customer journey are technologies that on one side help customers to identify themselves a identity authentication of identification cars face recognition technology stuff like that which makes it really easy for customers to onboard into new platforms new banks that's one side the other side is everything that has to do with artificial intelligence in order to help customers to understand what their behavior delivers in terms of what kind of person they are and therefore what kind of financial advice fits with them so that they feel truly empowered to take the decisions they need to take [Music] in order to build trust in the future because the trust is affected by the personal relationship so basically the fact that customers can actually go and visit a branch and can relate to a person that is fading away with banks with branch closures and people do more and more online so the trust factor that comes now in place is the trust factor that has to be built through making sure that whatever advice you render is really recognized as an advice that the customer can relate to as one that is specific tailored to its situation to his or her situation on the back of the data and the behavior that that customer shows so the way you have to deliver your services your products has to be very personal and has to be very simple and understandable on in that way normal people honestly and which is 99% of us will feel empowered to make those financial decisions that they need to take both in the day-to-day banking situation as an investor area related to investing for the future [Music] so every investment that we make and every FinTech that we collaborate with they have to play a role in our strategy and our strategy is to deliver differentiating experience to our customers so every FinTech everything they can bring on board that is actually geared towards a strategy is one that we want to collaborate with and we want to invest it this can be in specific areas like payments like aggregation or Robert vice but can be broader as well the way you work with fintechs dough is different percentage some are a little bit bigger they have their own standards they have different banks they work with already and some are starting from scratch and they're looking for a enroll into a bank actually to test their technology so depending on where they are in their own development you have to work with them in a different way biggest challenges are on both sides of this collaboration on one side you'll have to explain the fintax that we're not a lab in which they can experiment to the next we're dealing with real customers with real customer information so whenever we release something it can't be just a trial because we have a brand to protect I promise to protect on the other side the challenge is also on the internal side clearly you know if you're an established bank motivating your people to collaborate with fintax sometimes it's different from many different angles the first findex works much faster they're much more agile and therefore you have to change the culture yourself and that's exactly what we've been doing over the last three four years we've been truly changing the internal culture to not only innovate ourselves but also to make sure that the collaboration with the findex works really well [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome back so I hope everyone is refreshed and raring to go so we're now going to move on to our second set of questions all of which will address the topic of collaboration models between fintechs and traditional financial services firms our first question in this section is one that sure to be right up the european team street how a challenger banks making their mark right now and we're going to go straight over to Richard for the European teams opening position on this one great thanks Gerry so I guess you've got to start off what is a challenger Bank say you've got three types to my mind you've got the branch and digital banks like Metro Bank in the UK or TSP my own Bank you got the digital only banks with heard from Simon from Lonzo had mentioned sterling as well and then you've got the front end banks the new banks that are sitting on top of other banks or where they've been banking I think we'll see a lot more of this people like Penza in Germany doing small business banking on Solaris as rails so then the question is what what mark is all that making if you've got huge diverse ecosystem of challenges out there and I think you've got to measure that by sort of two things one is customer adoption and you kind of look at the likes of munzo with half a million customers revolute with one and a half million customers you look at kelana in northern Europe and e-commerce got 10% now market share of e-commerce and sixty million end-users or ourselves TSB we've relent 10 million 10 billion pounds in mortgage lending in the last three years so there is like real impact there across that range of challenges from a people actually using it but I think it's also a question of beachheads for a lot of companies where they are looking to really get in say revolute with a prepaid card and FX and then build out a much fuller range of services thereafter so some of the impact is is very much still to come and I guess you can also measure impact in terms of the incumbent banks bearden europe bearding us and imitation is clear the greatest form of flattery and you see quite a little investment now particularly mobile apps the big incumbents trying to copy a lot of the features that the challenges are coming up with so I do think there is a pretty huge range of impact now coming from the challenges at least in Europe so I did have a quick look at a survey from psy boss money 2020 in preparation for this and top 50 digital-only banks in the world there was 22 from China and Asia and Africa to back up the comment made just before the break there was 23 from Europe and there was only 5 from North America so you guys got to watch me thank you very much Richard so to answer that question we're gonna send it over to Zach in the US so when I think about impact I don't think about usage I think about impact in terms of how you help your customer so when we look at these challenger banks especially in Europe how many of the underbanked are now banking how many people who weren't saving for retirement are now saving and investing for retirement and how many customers have these challenger banks actually helped pay down and get down get out of debt and so that's how I define impact and so using that lens I've seen largely a failure of challenger banks and other institutions that have meaningful impact on a lot of challenges of general consumers and so when I think about the impact that they have had it has changed a conversation so I love that we're having a conversation more focused on the customer more focused on how we use technology to serve customers and that is created I think a fire in the belly not just in some of the demographics of challenger banks that you articulated but also in ones that are larger banks like Goldman Sachs our friend beau from Marcus and in some ways when I think of the firm I work for USAA in many ways we've been a challenger bank since we found it and I'd like to share some of those principles one we were customer centric before customer centric was cool and became a tagline to sell something like an AI based chat bot for three decades we were a virtual bank with no branches our customers could not come see us and so along the way we use technology we invented something called remote deposit capture which enabled you to take a picture of a check and deposit it because we trusted our members enough that they wouldn't cheat us and guess what they didn't because they trust us and so when I look at a challenger we are a challenger in terms of how we approach serving our customers and I would just offer back out to all those folks who call themselves challengers what impact are you having on consumers and are you just saying I'm consumer friendly and using technology are you actually doing that ground when it comes to customer acquisition but there's still a way to go when it comes to social impact so if you liked what you heard and you think that one side has the edge there please do remember to head over to Twitter to vote and whilst you're doing that I'm gonna hand it over to Simon Taylor who's gonna deliver the --use rebuttal you know I absolutely love that song needs to talk right now that's that's making my whole world some I can feel you really really wanting to talk I'm just gonna remind the world that Sam wants to talk and if you want to vote for Europe about the fact that I'm mocking Sam that he wants to talk go right ahead it's right there on the screen how you vote for Europe to win so what a challenge your bank's doing well I don't know if you've heard of pocket on monies but actually they serve migrant workers who couldn't get bank accounts and the problem with not being able to have a bank account when you migrate into a country is then you can't get a mobile phone contract which often means you can't get a place to rent which often means you can't get a mortgage or anything else that you need that's the basic essentials of living so what are they doing they're making real differences to people's lives they are having customer impact and I do think they're serving underserved segments I also think a lot of the challenge of banks are competing on service because they don't have a high legacy cost they don't have to pay for infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of people they can actually have a different business model and that's really powerful and expresses its worth in interesting ways rather than it being like a bad landlord rather than it being I'm gonna charge you and here's a fee and we're gonna make money off your FX and we're gonna hide all of these fees from you which a lot of the incumbent banks still do then challenger banks could be really transparent because they're making money because they have a low cost base there's more space for headroom there's more more space for revenue and profit with a lower cost of operating so they're also making a difference in terms of I didn't get surprised by the fact that I got charged and they can do something else because they've got modern infrastructure they can be real time intelligent and contextual what do I mean by that well a lot of banks don't know until the day after that money left my bank account and I may have gone overdrawn and I may have had a hidden fee in fact I'm gonna call in and talk to that now imagine the impact of somebody's life of that imagine if that means I'm not only have I gone overdrawn but I've got a relationship where I'm paying living day-to-day and there's too much month left at the end of the money now I find myself in a position where maybe I can't make rent maybe I'm having bad life consequences maybe I'm suffering from poor mental health as a result of not knowing where I am just because my bank has bad technology and you'd be surprised how common that is 2 out of 6 people in the UK right now are suffering some form of concern about money are they're really dealing with mental anguish from concern about money so being proactive being real time being intelligent and contextual really makes a difference for customers and that's what challenges are doing that all button banks can't do [Applause] thank you very much Simon so we're gonna go back to Dan for the us as rebuttal Oh Simon Simon I love you all right so for Team USA real quick a good point that was raised by the the first comment about only five US companies we're talk about challengers in tech but as fortunately those five would be like Amazon Facebook Google Walmart app all these take a pic so I'm gonna harp on a slightly different way of looking at it in terms of the size of the impact the Challenger banks have not within their own customers but across the entire service base so when you on musk founded Tesla he very clearly said the this is not actually to make a very valuable company it is to accelerate the rate at which we adopt electric vehicles and to get the technology rolling very quickly the example of that is that he said call it he made the patents for all of his technology public you can actually use Elon Musk's patent to build your own electric cars that's why we see a lot of the big companies for GM etc building electric cars using those patents I've been with betterment for four five years now when I joined we were the only person doing this in our space we were the only online adviser who is able to do it and over that period of time not only has every large bank entered into it to try and offer a robo-advisor they've done it while bringing their own costs down while cannibalizing their own revenue streams it's generally speaking a innovator or an entrant who decides that they want to serve customers directly by doing the right thing by lowering cost increasing efficiency or providing a higher quality of service has dramatic impact because they raise the standards that everybody else has to live by if a start-up this VC batt can do this why can't some of the largest banks with the biggest balance sheets in the country do anybody else thank you for the team response fair that was a to party-to-party approach um to give us a little bit of a wrap-up on that round we now have Elias Sam first come on you don't need to steal the space to try to put your hat and front choice or socks or things much better for you so what do changing Bank do they change banks let's look at all the bank that we have in Europe that are and the million of customers half a million a million Mons oh and 26 Clara is way beyond Starling banks and so on and so forth transferwise are all these banks or this challenging banks are making banks easier are making banks more engaging are creating the right experience clearly traditional banks the study in Europe and friends that had shown that Bain & Company has shown that French banks have not got new customers since 2015 it does emitter has no customers but not going to traditional banks they are going somewhere these guys are banking if you look also what's happening in France you have a conical who's now opening bank account outside of the bank banks everywhere but not in a branch all that is about the challenging bank great thank you everyone and now we're gonna go back over to Jill he's gonna take us into round seven okay first we must do a little business here round five so the first hour of our debate has now been decided round five goes to Europe so they won three rounds the Americas won two rounds got some business to do here gang remember you can vote via Twitter just follow the directions on your screen and weigh in at hashtag WFT r18 we are now into round seven FinTech firms obviously the big disruptors and in the Capgemini linkedin FinTech report these firms actually say their agility and ability to provide enhanced customer experience are their key competitive advantages so our question for round seven how can traditional financial institutions accelerate and improve their engagement with startups so that they can tap into these advantages for the u.s. opening position Jeff take it away thank you so I think the first question and the mistake that I think often firms of all sizes make as they they sort of view the technology as pixie dust and that somehow if they sprinkle it on their organization that this is this wonderful thing will occur and you know you can't get away from understanding what what is your strategy what's your competitive advantage and how do you use technology to enable that so at a small company like Morgan Stanley we we think that our core value proposition is is our human is our human financial advisors and by the way I can factually tell you through all over data and analysis that people still like to communicate with people and so the question doesn't become how do we use technology to replace that value proposition the question becomes how do we use technology to augment that relationship and really driving insights and scale so that human being can have more human conversations and I will tell you that I'm the chief analytics officer we use random forests equations to drive really innovative things but I can tell you the single most powerful thing that a financial adviser can do today is uh take someone to lunch or pick up the phone and call a client and then you enable that relationship with with technology the second thing I'd say is that you have to know what you can outsource and what you have what you can't outsource you cannot outsource your data management issues you cannot outsource sort of defining what your value proposition is and what we see time and time again and talking to my peers is people really try to overcome those problems and try to hand that off to somebody else nobody can define your strategy and then the last thing I'll say is you need an infrastructure to really engage the velocity you know with velocity around this so we were out in Silicon Valley six months ago I met with 30 machine learning based organizations that are trying to really really try to move the needle in this space and after you talk to 30 companies you get a really good sense and and really understanding how you can vet those opportunities that ultimately because you can hear everyone saying well I'll talk a good game the only way you really know who's real and who's not is you got a test and that means you've got to invest dollars of your organizational money to actually vet and and determine whether these technologies are real or whether they're just paper thank you very much Jeff and now for the opening EU position we are going to Claire so the first point is Renea other purpose when you are engaged for startups and for us it was about partnering we've started boot camp in tech and Nektarios is going to do a rivet olia and over the last three years we created our own search companies that have an average revenue of 2.2 million one of them is called yeop and when we started in the accelerators that we are very early stage where to early stage to engage your bank lectroids banking group but you know what we had coffee suppliers all around the country and they were a way to pay at your fingertips and all on your coffee and then you just pick up the coffee L by DT and beatings at you they've been running in our coffee operation for like two years and two years after us have been approached by our main business as hope by the way do you want to form part of our offering and today they are part of the offering of Lloyds Banking Group so the story goes you know by doing some things that was quite disinterested at the beginning to just help a startup to progress and just like you know make them make the fin tech ecosystem flourishing in the UK to beef up and to finally be part of the ecosystem of that working group the second part is really thin thin Beach you know one of the thing we did as well was launching of FinTech mentoring activities which is like we pledged 100 of our top senior memories in Lloyds Banking Group and we match them with startup it's quite inorganic we don't really have a purpose when we do that we just obvious business grow and flourish because we just see this as an interest for the country about growing talent about delivering it so I think you know my main message is really you know think around the purpose when you do this engagement and and follow a bit like your heart when you do is at under just the economic reality about it but let's elevate the debate a little bit because I think you know we're talking about startups on this nimble startup and surely you know incumbents I started having to share about the culture about all ways of working and about the expertise banks have you know in terms of regulation and you know customer experience but I think you know one of the environment we don't talk about is the buffers and to get so how do we engage you know this technology company that are currently serving the customer and I was China recently and I really think there is something that we need to tap into it and I would expand that and say like the party just get bigger why are we just talking about FinTech and incumbents you know whether we not talking about every part of the chain that is or what are we not talking about the government about the regulator about to FinTech about the startup about the visas and this is what we have done in the UK but putting them all together around the table on the beauty of in tech fine and say okay guys how do we ok that is a lot to swallow for the opening positions if you would like to vote just follow the instructions at the bottom of the screen hop on to Twitter vote for either the Americans or the Europeans or you can wait for the rebuttals and delivering our rebuttal for the Americas is Jane so I'm very fortunate to represent the voice of the founder and I know there's a bunch of founders in the room and often these conversations about how to fin how to fintax collaborate with financial institutions it's 90% financial institution and 10% FinTech and guess what like it's not a big secret but four founders and for fin takes time as money when you have a two-year buying cycle that's not good for me it's really really not and so I was very heartened to see the Capgemini announcement today about the certification program so less those startups more so scale ups being certified around you know are they real businesses are they ready to engage all of this is awesome what I would love to see is a similar process on the other side and Capgemini you can give me some rev share for this idea because it's really good it is your institution actually ready to engage and like the questions that at the c-suite are answered very easily once you get into the weeds of the operators it gets very messy so you know is there room in the roadmap for this can be answered by everybody and generally the answer is no but it's something we're interested in next year guess what doesn't really help me because next year can come around and then it gets pushed to the next year is there money for Jane like that's kind of important again the answer is often no but it's a huge priority for us it's like okay so is this really the third really big thing is you know what is your process and often you focus on the pointy end of the process for startups it's the innovation teams it's maybe product maybe c-suite maybe customer experience our time is actually spent with your risk compliance marketing legal PR teams and that can take you know three weeks to get a meeting set up and so be really aware of how long things take because if just to get to the MOU take six months nine months maybe a year then you can assume it's going to take a whole lot longer after that so in order to accelerate have a process that can actually get you in there faster and there's another whole big thing again taking it out of scale ups and back to startups I think it's clear from the data that the venture world funds the hopes and dreams of 28 year old white men right so if you're putting women and people of color through the same process as you put the startup so it raised a hundred million in venture then you can take your we really even care about diversity and you know what you can put it because the money needs to follow thank you okay thank you very much I was brilliant for the European rebuttal Nektarios [Music] damn you Jane you'd take taken away on arguments let's start with a different question I'm looking at all of you who are watching this and have an innovation role in a bank who talk about all the appetite that you have about working with syntax because it's cool and you've got labs and garages and bean bags and post-its if I bring the best startup in the world that solves a real problem to you and the enterprise ready they've proven the technology they've got customers and I put them in front of you and say go what are you going to do how long is it going to take how long are you going to excite the right people are you going to make the money available and all the things that Jane talked about because you're absolutely rubbish at doing this and let's not kid anybody reality is that most startup engagements with the last organization's frizzle out because of the inability of the industry to engage nothing to do with the startups they're keen they want to learn they want to talk none of the founders we talk to want to bypass the industry or bypass regulation they want to have a fair chance in this but reality is that despite all the appetites despite all the noise all the conferences or the panel conversations all the calls happen on each other's shoulders step talking about how amazingly innovative we are all we are a technology company with a banking license rubish reality is you're not ready you have no appetite sorry you have no capability beyond the appetite if you don't sit down and think what is it that we need to build to actually get to that point how do we bridge that huge chasm between appetite and capability and there's lots of things you can do and there's a lot of organizations who are trying and nobody has figured it out but at least people try but there's a lot of people now let's go you know what and we're talking heads of innovation who say you know what don't tell me what I'm doing is wrong I've sold my strategy to the board I'm not touching this now seriously 2018 FinTech is this your strategy how do you measure success how do you actually figure out what works and what doesn't work how do you get the business excited enough to actually put money towards it because the innovation budget is actually shrinking so all these things nobody's addressing so all this talk about collaboration is noise because nobody's actually doing something about it I'm sorry that's it I have 24 seconds left but I've got nothing else to say oh thank you very much okay Shanker are one of our co-captains here in the Americas how about a quick summary thank you all that was a pretty interesting conversation so I think that one cannot do without the other I think the future is all about how do we have an hybrid model you can have a smart idea two guys in a garage no customers are no data screw you you're worth nothing so you need the banks to take their customers and data and make something out of it and also I've heard these banks are departing forever actually when I saw this morning they're better capitalized and stronger than two decades ago and the spyder is actually doing cracking well compared to tech stocks which are actually tracking the other way so I think that everybody's right and everybody is wrong I think the two of us have to come together and kind of I agree the point that with a lot of banks it takes time to bring in the startup but that's because what happens if the startup is out of business who's going to bail the bank up so that's where the entire ecosystem needs to play ball and come together like never before so that the smart ideas go to the bank germinate could be faster okay thank you very much all right now here in the Americas we're gonna have to work to do because we have our round six winner is Europe oh it's very subdued here are very sad face there they are I don't know what they're doing some sort of Olympics dance I think if you'd like to vote head to Twitter follow the directions at the bottom of your screen and now we're gonna go over to Sarah who will introduce round 8 thank you very much Jill and excellent work team Europe let's see if we can keep going keep that winning streak going so we're gonna move on to round eight now we all know that one of the most important elements for the success of any innovation project is a supportive culture and that's even more key when multiple parties are involved so our eighth question will dig into the subject matter what role does talent and culture play in a successful FinTech incumbent collaboration and to kick us off on this we're going over to Claire so talent is critical people are pretty good in this story I think we've sorted out it's you know it's in the beginning of this debate and I think if you're really take only one action out of all these debate please go online and play josephine tech parity because one of the key issue we have in FinTech is really around our diversity the recent report of McKinsey shows that companies that are diverse perform 21 percent better and such as chokers and better if their ethnicity diverse it is a call to action you know we cannot just ten steel if we want to match the customer base if we want to engage or talents if we want to serve the best service for the customer we have to become diverse we have to bring this different talent I've led innovation team for five foreign l fear and I remember some interviewing me one day and say hey Claire did you realize your team is coming from all across the world and I was like haha I didn't really realize that or I didn't do it internally we just went to hand the best talent to make it happen and they were coming from everywhere in the world Australia America you know like Poland Africa they were all coming together to build these best services talent is key the second thing is culture we've been talking about it disrupting the old ways of working we've been talking about bureaucracy we've been talking about you know what are the challenges in this startup incumbents engagement how do you do that how do you become nimble how do you take the leap of faith for organizations that are very neurotically wired and start to be a connected organization how do you drive different type of thinking what we call the double loop thinking and you don't get stuck in the simple loop thinking how do you go don't just go after incremental but you actually motivate your people to achieve the best outcome for the customer and to come with the best solution and how do you enable your organization to do that through and through it is a tough challenge there is no silver bullet about it I've been asked for the last five years you know what is a magic recipe there is none of it you will have to put all your thoughts in order to do that we've built academies we've built cultural transformation programs we just have to keep pushing all together to make it better thank you very much Claire now we're going to go over to Zack in the US for that in position so I completely agree with with Claire although I would I would look at the the the need for for talent and diversity is really part of culture and what you champion because I'm a firm believer that the culture of the firm will eat anything and everything around it and if you do not have a healthy culture it doesn't matter how many startups you bring in how much you desire change you won't be able to and so as a leader in innovation much of my job is around culture and leading change and when I think about culture it's about a sense of purpose it's about a sense of being bigger than something than yourself and I see that in in some startups it's hard at times to find in large incumbents and I've been fortunate to find in the company I work for today and so we ground ourselves back in our culture which our mission and purpose and so every morning I wake up and I don't think about technology the first thoughts in my mind around service and service the customer and then secondarily I look at how do we leverage technology in order to enable that and that's where I find the opportunity talking to startups candidly talking to large technology firms and other corporates their challenge in terms of their Y in terms of what they're doing I get a hundred emails a day from someone trying to sell me an AI based chat bot blockchain based pfm app that will finally work but what I found is when I've paused and talked to founders who understand our Y who understand our purpose and have a connection back to the service that we provide to our customers our members that's where I find we could do very meaningful things and that's actually where I find where we can break down all those interior barriers because when you have a culture of your firm that is perfectly aligned against service and service a customer it is amazing what you can break down from legacy technology to legacy norms to old ways of thinking but if your partner your FinTech partner or other technology firms aren't aligned in your purpose it will fail at some point and so when I think of what I think of FinTech partnerships that have worked its where there's true alignment behind the why of the work they were doing and that's grounded back in the culture and the purpose of the firm that I work for thank you thank you very much Zak so in summary there we have that diversity is absolutely key but so is ensuring a cultural synergy and just to remind you that you can and should be voting especially if you're voting for Team Europe and whilst you're thinking about that we're gonna move over to Nick Terrace who's going to give us the rebuttal from the EU team so are people shy of actually talking about some of the other things none of the shareholders in a bank care about innovation or culture change innovation is a tick box and most people act on that because if you start reading meaning what you want to do you need to change incentives and the people to actually do innovation and trust me nobody in the business has real incentives to actually do something that will affect change one thing the other one is that we're in an industry and I come from the industry where research and development it's not something we do so innovation doesn't fit anywhere because ultimately we're in an environment where we need to enable and establish a mindset of experimentation experimentation is not going to lead to our why instantly and we already have a problem there because people are only incentivized for cost savings ROI so structurally the whole governance of a bank and take pretty much any bank in the world doesn't work it's not built to actually encourage an effect culture change the majority of the business that we do is working with large organizations so we actually have relationships with about 250 blue-chip companies around the world so we talk to these people we actually have got access to c-suite and guess what we've got one case where the CEO the CFO and the CTO signed off of an engagement and then he got stuck in the permafrost of senior management who have absolutely no appetite and guess what when it comes to the 2% of whatever is part of the innovation remit and the kind of conflicts with other priorities the first thing to fall off the table is change so this is not going to work it's not set up to work so the companies that really mean it they're also looking to change some of the very fundamentals where the increase the visibility of their activities and not just to take a box so for me the big question is cultural change is important and culture is important if we can do all these beautiful things that excite the population within the bank but guess what at some point it gets stuck somewhere because you have no avenue to actually grow it if you follow the big leaders on innovation we used to talk about technology and and fin second or the other things and nowadays they talk about organizational change which is the only thing that can actually allow this industry to evolve but at the moment I'm very pessimistic and of my contribution Thank You NIC Tereus some fighting talk there I think perhaps so now we're gonna head over to Katherine in the US for her rebuttal obviously I approach this from a thin tech perspective um when talent it seems really obvious to us yes you have to have really smart bright talented people in order to make these relationships work with banks and cultural alignment is really important and from our perspective and in our experience when the relationships work really well it's because inside the bank that the initiative is being led from the top so we saw Ralph hammers earlier I believe during the break talking about what what's important I and G we partner with ING and we know for a fact that he's out there talking to people and getting people excited and engaging in the culture and creating a culture where people can take risks but culture I think many people think is all about ping pong and beer like Nick Theriot said earlier I've been through many many innovation labs at banks and write the Middle's a ping pong table and then they are excited to walk you over the beer cooler where there's four bottles of beer you know stuck in the cooler but it's really not about that it's really about innovation I think in risk-taking and I and so what banks were attracted to with fintechs is our ability to innovate and to take risks which we do because we adhere to some guiding principles in our case we actually walked away from a big Bank partner because we were gonna have to to walk away from our guiding principles in order to make that relationship work and it wasn't worth it to us I think the second thing culturally that's really important about working with a large institution from a fintechs perspective is to have a culture of compliance so I don't know if you all remember the Mother's Day Massacre which is a couple of years ago and all the details of some of the issues around lending came out the problem with what happened there was it it impacted the entire FinTech space because suddenly whether it was the capital markets or always the bank partners or whether was the investors everybody was worried the suddenly fintechs didn't understand compliance and I know that Clara mentioned earlier as did Suresh that compliance is a really important aspect so the culture of compliance means that you understand how to approach compliance with the bank partner there are two types of compliance there's regulatory compliance and there's process compliance regulatory compliance is just something you have to do whether it's a ml or kyc or whether it's disclosure to your customers you just have to do it process compliance is really the problem it's where there's a whole roomful of people who say oh you have to check this box every time you do a thing and if you don't check the box then there's gonna be trouble why'd it to check the box well because some dude 70 years ago decided we had to check the box and that's just why we do it so it's really important culturally to push back against that type of process compliance to make sure you can actually achieve everybody's objectives thank you very much for that Katherine so Elias could you give us a quick summary of your thoughts on round 8 risk-taking I think it's clearly the main message that we got across the last debate but so let me put that in a very simple way what's MVP stands for when you're a startup it's the minimal Viable Product when you're a bank it's the maximal Viable Product so when you start this way it's very difficult to bring these two together startups need to be in the market needs to run need to test banks need to make sure that it's do it will not fail so this is where the culture start and the more we bring these two culture together the more we help them we orchestrate this gathering the more we'll get them together clearly both sides need each other banks today need startup to innovate innovates needs bank to scale so bring them together is the way and culture is what will bring them together to go together thank you Thank You Elias so now we're going to go back to my US counterpart for both the results of the round seven vote and an intro into round nine Elias I just want to let you know for the aging athletes in this room the only thing that MVP means is Most Valuable Player and so I just want to get that out there round seven the winner is the Americas don't forget to go onto Twitter so you can vote use the hashtags at the bottom of your screen and weigh in on the conversation hashtag WFT r18 we are coming into round nine two rounds remaining this is exciting rapid change in technology challenges upstarts and established firms alike boundaries between companies and industries are becoming blurred and so our question for round nine is this who will be the long-term winner as banking evolves to a marketplace model incumbents fintechs or big tech and as a follow up we as we consider big text strong relationship with consumers and efficiency and creating frictionless tech transactions or Google Apple Facebook Amazon Gotha a threat or a partner or enabler now we just happen to have a Facebook pro a woman who actually wrote a book about Facebook on our panel and putting out the opening statement for the Americas Clara shy so again as before let's talk about digital only and digital advised for digital only I think the challenge for FinTech players is that they're gonna have to get to scale really quickly in order to be able to matter and not be subsumed by a copycat incumbent used to it's possible you look at other industries like uber and lyft they've raised massive amounts of money and because so those early years the early decade is really about client acquisition and building your brand so it is possible um I do think that also big techs have a big advantage if you look at China and the two biggest FinTech players are WeChat and Alibaba started off as tech companies the consumer relationship alone isn't enough you actually have to have a consumer payment relationship in order to be able to grow as the FinTech in both cases they started off in the WeChat case with virtual goods getting people's payment method through virtual goods and the Alibaba case very very similar to Amazon doing transactions for e-commerce so for the big text to win in America or in Europe we'd have to make sure that you have the payment method now let's talk about digital advised um for a moment so digital advise I think no one today really would be really difficult for any upstart today to be able to raise the capital and justify building 5000 branch locations hiring 20,000 human advisers and so I think here the incumbents will have a real advantage in terms of they already have that infrastructure in place their challenge will be getting the profitability and improving productivity as margin pressures continue to increase and I think that that it's possible but there should expect to see over time industry consolidation in general for both digital only as well as digital advised given the nature of technology the economies of scale required to to build a marketplace two-sided marketplace multi-sided marketplace as well as the the network effects inherent in anything technology will we'll start to see a overall convergence because technology is generally winner-takes-all that's why there's only goober and left a very few number of players in that space that's why there's only Amazon Facebook there's only one Amazon one Facebook one Google we should expect to see the same thing in financial services thank you okay and for the Europeans opening position we are going to Richard right so let me talk first of all from the Bank perspective so a lot of people say marketplace is not a new thing banks have sold add-ons like insurance or small business software for decades that's kind of true but it's sort of totally missing the point today you can create so much better customer experience via fully integrated a frictionless processes to bring much wider surfaces contextually to a customer and I think it's also about mindset here for a bank you've got to be prepared to offer customers choice and that choice is not just on add-on stuff you don't do yourself as a bank it is about choice in the products you do yourself let's talk about Amazon for a second Amazon does this with Amazon Marketplace Amazon has its own products on Amazon and offers third-party products and it provides you an easy comparison the two that provides better customer experience but its customer trust and it also provides great data for Amazon to improve their own product set but actually this isn't really that much about banks this question the question is about really is gath are gonna take over financial services and I guess to my mind the question is just wrong we've talked about China a fair bit we she's kind of talked about trying that a lot more because this is not about Google Amazon Facebook this is about by the Alibaba Tencent I've been to China a couple of times in the last year and you get a hangjo with Alibaba you get a suntan with ten cents and you kind of see the future 10 cent has a super app via chat that includes payments you can book a doctor you can invest in a fund you can book a restaurant you can split a bill you can order that restaurant you can go on and on the range of jobs to be done is astonishing you can do through this one out so I guess you kind of look at Facebook 95% the revenue comes from advertising off social media it's a great social media site but $0.10 it's only 25% comes advertising 75% it's all much wider range of services so I guess from my point of view you've really got to look east for the future not west knife one welcome our ally paymaster's all right well said they're really interesting to bring this up I think that many of us feel like those big names are taking over the world it's nice to know there are other large names that will be taking over the world instead all right maybe it's not that nice remember you can vote right now go to Twitter use the hashtags at the bottom of your screen and now let's get to our rebuttal for the Americas we've got Bo who will be speaking first so this is actually one of my favorite questions I can remember sitting in London a couple years ago and the question was well isn't Apple Amazon Facebook and Google and others going to dis disenfranchised or dissing your mate the banks from their customers and it was actually a really really intense and robust debate in that time and in the room I actually kind of started chuckling because I thought to myself that's actually incorrect everybody wants to create this battlefield of the incumbent banks the fintechs and the large tech companies and I think that's actually very wrong and if we talk about the roadmap let's talk about the roadmap so the legacy banks you want to talk about stickiness and customers that's the legacy banks right I mean I you know God you know I salute all the fintechs around the world big supporters but the population uses the legacy banks to do the banking now innovation right so you have scale on the legacy side but innovation comes from the fintechs and I for one I'm excited and actually very supportive of the fact that fintechs took the courage and creation to jump out there into the market and actually be R&D and actually create great customer experiences and that to me is not an adversarial relationship because I remember several years ago it was the fintechs are gonna eat all the big banks we have scale we have the funds the fintechs have the innovation it's a partnership and when I came to Marcus by Goldman Sachs that's actually my first step was how do I actually bring together not only the people who understood regulation and compliance for banks because you need that regardless of what anybody would like to think and you need the innovation of the fintechs and that together creates a marriage of how you put customers first and you bring them the best functionality as you move forward then let's bring in the big players Facebook Google Amazon I'd even throw Microsoft in that as well right they incredible customer experience they own it and people flock to use their services because they provide their services for free all of them have attempted become banks and they've all backed away from it why it's hard and there's a reason why it's hard is because it's very important and you have to be responsible and focused on that and to me that actually is an opportunity for partnerships so I don't think that there's this adversarial you know dog-eat-dog battle that's going on I actually think it's massively convergent these big players want to go a little bit deeper as a colleague in the Europe I said deeper in the relationship and deeper in the experience as Clara's pointing out technology will eat the world right and folks are moving to that you can see it in Africa and other places as well and to me the road map ends were these three converge and we actually create an incredible new platform we just made it right into the belt okay let's go over to Europe where Jamie will deliver the rebuttal well let me tell you about that incredible new platform so two and a half years ago we started bud because we noticed one big thing which was fin tech was on the rise and people were getting better experiences in each of these new product verticals you had transferwise making remittance much better in a much better experience and for better rates you had nutmegs and other Robo advisors who were making investment easier for for customers and across the board you've had all these new companies you know who are developing these new products and services in their own individual vertical but customers don't really want to go and get another app for one thing in multiple different apps for all these different services the mass customer is used to going to one place for all of their financial services their bank so bud was created as a way of combining all of these new product innovations across the FinTech space integrating those services into our platform and making that platform available to banks so they can distribute these new amazing products to their customers I think when you look at something like this this model which we call marketplace banking here in the UK really it's Europe and UK who are pioneering these new methodologies and getting these new products to market in it in a new way you have challenge of banks like Manzo & N 26 who have already kind of put their flag in the ground saying that they're going to be doing marketplace models and really it's borrowing from the experience of the likes of Amazon and and even travel companies like Expedia look at the way that they revolutionize those those markets by bringing all of these services together in a new way making customers incredibly aware of all the services that were available to them giving them choice and that choice gives them power and it gives them information that they can take and inform their lives and have better experiences at the outcome I think when you really look at the heart of you know who is going to kind of swoop into financial services and and and and take the crown really I can't I don't think you can look at the Facebook's and the Amazons because when you you know look deep down in these companies where do they keep their money in a bank you know it's not going to change and I think by partnering with platform companies such as ourselves banks will start to have a new ticket to the game which will allow them to be innovative it will allow them to be agile and serve their customers in a brand new way okay they keep their money in a bank usually in offshore one at least for the time being okay Sam how about articulating a little recap for us so the question is who will be the long-term winner as banking balls so marketplace models incumbents fintechs or Big Tex I don't care the customer I mean seriously the the customer everybody's gonna win that but at the end of day the customer should win what we're seeing this in China right a whole group actually now being raised up right they're middle class emerging we've seen this in Africa with them paisa that's what these solutions need to do neck toria's talked about it I think Simon hit on it Jamie evidently didn't get product for his hair today it's the smallest I've ever seen his hair but that's who needs to win at the end of the day providing these services to the masses thank you very much okay we have a very curious event here we have the round 8 coming in at 8 I which means we'll have to go to a shootout no just kidding all right so uh no shoot we will enter now into our final round remember if you'd like to vote right now you can do so just follow the instructions at the bottom of your screen go to Twitter pick out whether it's the Americas or your final round Sarah take us to the end well this is getting exciting it sounds like everything is left to play for on both sides so let's get into our grand finale today's final question pits the Europeans and North Americans against each other once more we all know that regulation is integral to the financial service industries development and indeed its evolution but which approach is more effective a european-style top-down regulatory approach or a u.s. style market driven one so we're gonna start with Jamie over to you the European team's opening position so regulation it is the rules that everyone in this industry has to play by and I think when you look at things like sports rules are there to kind of stop it all disintegrating into absolute chaos but what regulation also does is it creates high walls around this kind of sacred garden that is financial services so when you look at the European model and what they've tried to do with the likes of kind of open banking and regulatory sandbox initiatives what they're what they're doing is they're lowering these walls for entrance into this market and that is spurred on a wave of competition and a wave of innovation that I think is pretty unprecedented when you look around the world so I'm gonna talk first about the sandbox initiative from the from from the SCA but was involved in the first cohort of the FCA sandbox we're also involved in the third cohort of the FCA sandbox and really that's a way for people to safely trial new initiatives with a closed group of Schumer's for a set period of time against the set hypothesis that is a way for not only us as a start-up to learn but also the regulator to learn about our business and how that is going to affect the market a crucial piece of the puzzle that needs to happen otherwise that kind of initiative falls on its on its on its knees and then secondly open banking and PSD to allow it you're breaking down the walls around banking data so that customers can take that data and use it and have it analyzed in any way they choose that's one of the key parts about you know that's going to introduce new competition in this market and that also touches on payments as well breaking down the walls of large payments companies so that you know a customer can initiate a bank to bank transfer from wherever they choose pending them being regulated I think this kind of innovative play playing field that the regulation and the regulatory environment of Europe has set out is absolutely the right way to go because if the rules that everyone plays by and without that you know you get into some real sticky situations looking at other markets where there should have been regulation just look at the u.s. just look at the the US Aviation Department look at the look at the for big players there and the lack of regulation what that leads led to hopefully we won't have any customers being dragged out of bank branches by their feet in any time some talk better finish on thank you very much Jamie so Catherine over to you for the u.s. is opening position I do hope that our voters don't confuse what I'm about to say with a vote for Team Europe but it seems pretty hard to argue that the u.s. market-based regulatory regime is as effective as the European based model so I'm not here to argue on behalf of the Americans but I am here to suggest that the reason that that model works is because it really involves a very strong focus on the customer experience and on customer rights customer ownership of data and that's very very important I think the difference is in the u.s. regulator and policymakers and lawmakers believe that the customer is the business is the financial institution is the bank whereas the European model assumes that the customer is actually the consumer and that's a really important distinction I spend a lot of time in DC and I spend some time talking with someone a policy maker about FCRA the Fair Credit Reporting Act which is really archaic and arcane and has been revised a couple of times but doesn't take into a fad and took into account any of the new data and tools and technology that could be brought to bear for the lending process and front making a credit evaluation for example social data it could be used to help provide more access to capital more access to credit for the underserved in the underbanked and the new to the market so I think that's the difference between a principles-based regulatory regime which is what Simon mentioned earlier and the market driven model so the market driven model in the u.s. also hasn't driven any advancements on the regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions so appropriate regulation is really important we make loans to small businesses I don't transfer money I don't take deposits I don't make investments for my customers so it's really important that we figure out how to regulate appropriately for exactly what a company is doing and not burden them with a bunch of cumbersome regulations that aren't even applicable and I think that's what's been slowing us down so again I think it's really important to embrace the model that the Europeans have taken with PSD to and GDP are focusing on the customer experiencing focused both on the customer experience focusing on their access to data and realizing that they're really the ones who are driving the market thank you very much Catherine and Jamie as well so it looks like we have a vote of confidence for the European regulatory system which may make the rebuttals slightly easier before we get to that I just want to remind the audience that time is running out to vote so please head over to Twitter and make sure you do that Simon would you like to give a rebuttal I feel like you've a relatively easy starting point there so since we've already agreed that the European system of regulation is preferable to an open market I'll just add a few things I think regulation cannot just regulate markets but it can create new markets the open banking initiative here was driven by PSD to a piece of legislation that applies to all banks but the competition of Markets Authority here in the UK decided to really get ahead of that and make the largest nine banks sort of do all of the work upfront they made them basically create api's or conform to an api standard before they were even required to and that wasn't to sort of like suppress competition it wasn't to limit the free market it was to basically make all of the customers data available to the customers it was the sort of raised the amount of customer data that was available so that FinTech companies like bharden and others that want to build things on top of that data could have the assurance that that data was going to be there right so the the point of that regulation was not to control a free market it was to create a new market and the other thing I would say about especially in London is in the u.s. you have all of the tech in San Francisco and all the regulators in in DC and all of the money in in New York its 1,400 meters from silicon roundabout which is the spiritual center of tech in the UK to the Bank of England that's about naught point 9 miles so beat that thank you very much Simon and so we are heading back to Jeff for the final rebuttal of today's event so I think you know what happens in the regulatory world is an interesting conversation but candidly most of us in this room have absolutely zero impact on what the regulator's do or don't do so I think the more interesting question is how do you use both the regulatory regimes that are out there and how do you use sort of this free market approach to actually get people excited and the truth is neither actually get people excited for the average financial adviser they don't even know who the OCC is or the SEC and they just see that as sort of a way that gets some way of them doing business and also if you try to sell these things as this big innovation play most people don't care about that either I mean the people on this call on this webcast probably innovation focused and we're like we need to innovate we innovate nobody cares about that either and I would just go back to really a theme that I think is sort of played out here through through the whole conversation is going back to what the client wants knowing what your competitive advantages as an organization to drive that and solve real problems right I guess I go to bookend this by saying all of this is interesting unless it speeds a client experience drives a better investment outcome for client creates alpha if you are not doing those things you are failing and by the way sometimes you do those things it has nothing to do with technology it may have to do with business processes it may have to do with better training of your employees it may be communicating your goals and objectives more clearly and I guess I would end by saying let's not forget that those things still matter leadership still matters cooperation still matters and for all the conversation about FinTech I still believe that our success and failure rest on those fundamental capabilities thank you thank you very much Jeff and now over to Simon the other Simon for our final summary of the day so I think it's interesting that we got to remember the fundamentals we go remember to serve customers or really thinks interesting about the principles based regulation approach that both of these gentlemen mentioned is that it does serve customers it is in their interest is and it I think it really matters that people who are underserved and that couldn't get bank accounts before can now get bank accounts because FinTech companies are encouraged to do things and I think the principles based regulation is allowed for that and I think we all in this room and everybody listening can make a difference I don't think it's as hopeless as we can't make a difference we absolutely can and we can make a difference as these don't once said by going into the Sun boxes and now the OCC and the CFTC in the USA have Sun boxes go speak to your regulator people they're not that scary I think this is an exciting time for FinTech innovation know over to Jill for the final results nine winner is Europe which means because of our tie Europe is ahead five to three making it mathematically impossible for the u.s. to win at this point that said this has been an amazingly illuminating day for all of us I love talking about the overhyped and underwhelmed areas like identity management systems and blockchain I love the idea of how we can use our data and provide insights to enhance the customer journey I like the idea that banks have to show that they love us please print t-shirts immediately and also how we need to rethink not just our systems but our approaches to many of these problems I think we've all sort of agreed that blockchains not quite there yet but maybe there's something there unless it is a bet against humanity that would be a little scary where is the customer service being delivered I think it's you're you are Europe US China Africa fintechs established institutions startups maybe even those big tech companies I do believe as someone who comes from the financial services industry that the our ability to use technology to enhance customer relationships is really going to be the critical issue I like the the the sense of the collaboration between the established firms and fintechs really will rely on a diversity of talent of diversity of thought geographic diversity and that your culture is not just words at the top but filters through your entire organization as we kind of look ahead that that conversation around big tech and looking East versus West really opened my eyes in many ways regulation is always a little bit of a ginger topic for any of us i-i've always been much more impressed by the rules based versus the principles based but specifically the customer is clearly in the limelight here and maybe customers at least here in the US are gonna have to take charge a little bit more and demand more of our regulators I know that you guys know the sin here in this room but right now we have a regulatory regime that is being dismantled and I'll just put a plug in to my friends over at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who are being defunded right now at the expense of customers and consumers around the United States so with that said I do my friends and sunnyvale have a winner for me for round number 10 okay gang Europe has one round number ten if you're keeping score Europe will you just one six two three look at them doing some sort of wave some odd kind of characterization there of a wave and before we go I I do want to thank a bunch of people who made this possible first of all the the folks here at LinkedIn and at Capgemini and 11 FS have put on an amazing event Jennifer Grey zoals team LinkedIn Jam Chris Caspian amazing Capgemini build the team with Chirag Aaron Ken 11 FS Sam Simon Ali I would be remiss if I did not shout out our technology team here in New York we've got Dan leading the way David Sean Paul Tim Tommy David Brian our cameraman IDI Jeff Ramon and in Sunnyvale and in london romero gary joshua tersh whoo okay to close out this day I am pleased to introduce to you bill Sullivan head honcho is what I like to call him he goes by head of financial services market intelligence senior director at Cap Gemini bill great thanks a lot Jill and thanks everyone for tuning in today we really set out to have a different conversation in a different format I think we did a phenomenal job Jill Sarah absolute rock stars and managing this we put a lot on you and you you far over delivered on what we ever thought could be possible the debate captain's on the US side and the European side you guys did a great job and thank you for all the debate participants I know you took a big gamble on this format in terms of what we throw out there and what we were planning on doing I hope you enjoyed it I think it was a lot of fun you know please go back and watch the conversation I think there's a lot of relevant things happening we covered a lot of great themes you can go to the WWF ntek World Report com download the report that we just launched we covered all of the themes that we discussed in the in the debate today we've got some great agents of change videos that we've done which also have some senior leaders from fintechs from incumbents that also recovering these themes so I think we're in the and and Jennifer certainly thanks for the partnership it's been a phenomenal time it's our second year I think we able to you know jumped up the bar this year and it was a lot of fun so thanks everyone for joining and and have a great day"
